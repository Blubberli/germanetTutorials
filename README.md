# GermaNet API Tutorials

This repository contains two tutorials that show how to use the java- / python API for GermaNet

## Java API

You can find the tutorial in javaAPI directory. If you open it directly you can only see the code and the output in readonly mode, but you cannot run the code interactively. To do so you have to install jupyter and the ijava kernel.


### Install jupyter

You can install jupyter with pip:
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
or with conda:
```
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
```

### Install ijava kernel

Follow the instructions under *requirements* and *installing* to install the ijava kernel with jupyter
https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava#requirements

you can then go into the javaAPI directory on your machine and enter 
```
jupyter notebook
```


## python API
You can find the tutorial in pythonAPI directory. You also have to have jupyter installed. As a python version you have to select python 3.
Go into the pythonAPI directory on your machine and enter
```
jupyter notebook
```
